### Instacart

##### The Instacart project was developed based on the Instacart 2017 dataset and the price information fabricated by CareerFoundry. It was designed to propose marketing strategies for Instacart through customer analysis.

##### **Analyzed by Python Excel Tableau**


##### **Recommendations:** 
1.	Focus on Early Morning and Middle age & Mid-income group: Early morning hours are the least busy but generate the highest sales. Additionally, the middle-aged middle-income group constitutes the largest customer segment in terms of both population and spending.
2.	Develop new customers: The "Young & High income" group is the most vulnerable segment in Instacart's customer base. This group has purchasing power and is expected to transition into the middle-aged cohort, which will contribute the highest revenue to the company. Therefore, the low sales from this group pose a potential risk.
3.	Corporation Social Responsibility: The "Elderly low income" group represents a socially vulnerable demographic. This group has lower consumption of dairy and eggs, which could be linked to health-related concerns. Caring about them could be Instacart's social responsibility.
